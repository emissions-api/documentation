A local newspaper wants to generate a continuous plot of emissions data for
several substances in a given location. For example, the NOZ might want to
include a plot of the amount of SO² in Osnabrück. This image is supposed to be
updated on a regular basis.

To achieve this, it needs to be easy to request sensor data for a single
location and a single substance over time.
