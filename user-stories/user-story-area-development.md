Interested in metrics about the climate-change, a developer wants to know the development of an area, like Germany.
He wants to make a line or bar chart with the time on the X axis and one or multiple sensor data on the Y axis.

To achieve this goal he needs an API with fast access to the emission data aggregated over an area and time interval.
These data should be easily plot-able with JavaScript.

The data should generate single points aggregated over an area and time interval.
Locations for data from multiple time intervals should be identical.
